    "The main dataset that was used is not exactly one provided in the cluster. After careful analysis of the HTML webscraps in the recipe dataset, we found much more convenient to directly access the websites ourselves and scrap data on our own. The elected website was www.allrecipes.com. It is very structured, easy to navigate, and above all, all recipe pages are written the same way in HTML, a scraper's paradise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The site has little interesting details and perks that were exploited for our data collection. First of all, it is possible to add a 'print' statement to the URL to request a much cleaner HTML page, which facilitates scrapping immensely. Secondly, it is possible to specify in the URL the amount of servings the recipe is made for, and in which measuring system (metric, imperial) the ingredients' quantities have to be specified. Recipes are also given with a rating and the amount of people who pressed the 'made it' button which helps assess the recipe's popularity. By modifying the URL a bit, it is possible to request an HTML page containing the nutrition facts for the recipe (per serving), which does help quite a lot. Finally, the site is organized in a sort of tree structure, so it is easy to access all recipes in the same category (greek recipes for example).\n",
